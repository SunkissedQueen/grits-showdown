## 🍳 Great Grits Debate

***(Add your name and reason below the appropriate category)***

### 🧂 Team Savory  
_Because butter, cheese, and salt make everything better._

- Charlean — Savory — Because my tastebuds only guide me to deliciousness!

- Pilara — Savory — Definitely prefer salt, cheese, and butter.


### 🍯 Team Sweet  
_Because sugar, syrup, and cream belong on grits too._


### 🚫 Team No Grits  
_Because texture is everything and this one isn't for everyone._

### 🎗️ Remember

_Pull before you push, taste before you season._

_Keep the kitchen clean and commit with confidence!_
